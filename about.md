I am a Seattle area founder with over ten years experience delivering user focused products at scale. I have a wide variety of industry experience that spans larger companies ([Intel](https://intel.com) and [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)) to Series B funded startups ([Apptentive](https://apptentive.com)) to scrappy seed funded startups ([AppThwack](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/appthwack)). Now, I'm bootstrapping my own company [Routegy](https://routegy.com).

I spent my formative years in [Marquette, MI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquette,_Michigan) making me a [Yooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yooper), although I swear I don't [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_English) like it. I had been tinkering with computers/technology since an early age, so I graduated from [Northern Michigan University](https://www.nmu.edu/northern-michigan-university) with a [Computer Science](https://www.nmu.edu/mathandcomputerscience/home) degree. I got my start in the industry through a collaborative internship program between Intel and NMU working on building city-wide [WiMAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiMAX) networks and have building products/companies ever since.

In my free time, I enjoy outdoor backpacking, running, pub trivia, improv comedy, and working on many of my [open source projects](https://github.com/ahawker).

If asked to describe me, others would likely mention my attention to detail, quick wit, use of puns, and innate ability to recall obscure movie and TV show quotes.
